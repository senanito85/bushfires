                    <h2>Protect yourself</h2>
                    <p> Radiant heat can kill. You need to cover up, dress to protect yourself and take refuge form direct heat. In the past, people have been caught in bushfires wearing light summer dresses, shorts, singlets and even swimsuits. They usually die without the flames even touching their 
exposed skin. The real risks of bushfire are dehydration and heat stroke which can lead to unconsciousness and death. If you put your hand near an open flame, an electric heater element or electric light bulb, you can feel the radiant heat it generates. Draw your hand away and the 
amount of heat on your skin decreases. Put something between your skin and the heat source and again, your skin immediately feels cooler. This is the key to protecting yourself from radiant heat in bushfires - distance and shielding protect you from dangerous exposure. Bushfires usually occur on hot days. You and your family may be in shorts or swimsuits and bare feet and sandals. Remember, the deadly effects of radiant heat are increased by the amount of skin exposed to it. So as soon as you know there are bushfires in your area, cover up! 
Fire fighters wear protective gear to survive. So should you. Some personal protective clothing is general purpose and you will probably already have it. </p>
                    <h2>Appropriate personal protective clothing</h2>
                    <p>The heat will be intense so don’t overload yourself with tight-fitting, heavy clothes. Remember that everyone should prepare and have protective clothing when planning a camping. Radiant heat cannot penetrate through solid objects. It travels in straight lines. Taking shelter in pools, dams and water tanks is not a safe option. The air above the water will be dangerous to breath, and may be deadly when inhaled. The risk of physical injury is increased during a bushfire. 
These injuries can be caused by poor visibility, falling branches, hot objects, over exertion, emotional fatigue or falling from an unsecured ladder or rooftop. To reduce the likelihood of injuries, it is recommended that 
you wear appropriate protective clothing, move around your property with great care </p>

                    <h2>Reduce the risk of dehydration </h2>
                    <p>Dehydration occurs when the body loses more fluid than it gains. Dehydration is dangerous because it creates a build up of salts and minerals in the body tissues which 
put strain on the kidneys. When the kidneys fail, death can quickly follow. The high air temperature during a bushfire and the added stress of wearing extra clothing to shield against radiant 
heat will make you sweat heavily. People involved in active bushfire defence may lose up to two litres of fluid per hour. Some simple ways to avoid dehydration are: 
Keep COOL by splashing your face with cool water. Drink cool WATER often – even if you don’t feel thirsty. AVOID alcohol and fizzy drinks as they increase dehydration. Children and the elderly are especially vulnerable, so pay extra attention to their needs. Cool the skin by sponging with cold water. Make sure they drink frequently.</p>
                <h2> Protect yourself from smoke </h2>
                <p>Bushfire smoke contains particles of different sizes.  The impact smoke has on your health depends on your age, whether you have a respiratory or lung condition and 
your length of exposure. Signs of smoke irritation include itchy eyes, sore throat, runny nose and coughing.  For most healthy adults the effects of smoke exposure will clear up quickly after the smoke goes 
away.</p>
                 <h2>If caught on the road</h2> 
                 <p>Remember, if your plan is to leave early when a fire is burning in your area, do so before the fire threatens and 
road travel becomes hazardous. Leaving late is a deadly option. Declaration of a Total Fire Ban, or other high fire 
risk days, should be your trigger to put your Bushfire Survival Plan into action. If you are driving and see smoke ahead, always u-turn to 
safety if you have the option.  Avoid being caught out on the road during a fire as it is highly dangerous - a car will 
not offer safe protection from the radiant heat.  However, if you are caught in a fire do not get out and run.  Being 
in a car is still better than being in the open. Pull over to the side of the road into a clear area – a dirt track may be the best option     Try not to park the car in a place where it is 
surrounded by vegetation that will burn -  avoid long dry grass and scrub. Park behind a solid object, if possible, such as a bus shelter of brick toilet block clear of vegetation.
    Ensure all windows and doors are tightly closed and shut all air vents.Put the hazard lights and headlights on so other vehicles can see you. Cover exposed skin as much as possible with clothes made of natural fibres
    Get down as low as possible below window level and cover up with a woollen blanket until the fire front passes. Remember to drink lots of water to stop yourself form dehydrating. Move to safety only when you will feel a reduction in the heat. Always carry a woollen blanket in your car if travelling 
in the country during the fire season
